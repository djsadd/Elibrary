# Public API base URL for the frontend to call.
# Use a fully-qualified, externally reachable URL.
# Examples:
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-ngrok-subdomain.ngrok.app

VITE_API_URL=

# Notes
# - When deploying behind the provided nginx image (Dockerfile), you can leave VITE_API_URL empty.
#   All requests will go to the same origin and /api will be proxied to $API_SERVER.
# - For cross-origin deployments (Netlify/Vercel/etc.), set VITE_API_URL to your backend URL
#   and ensure CORS allows your frontend origin, Authorization header and Range requests.
